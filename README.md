# Datastar Plugin for Craft CMS

### A template-driven, reactive hypermedia framework for Craft CMS.

This plugin integrates the [Datastar hypermedia framework](https://data-star.dev/) with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/), allowing you to create reactive front-ends driven by Twig templates. It aims to replace the need for front-end frameworks such as React, Vue.js and Alpine.js + htmx, and instead lets you manage state and use logic within your Twig templates.

Use-cases:

- Live searching elements
- Loading more elements / Infinite scroll
- Paginating, ordering and filtering lists of elements
- Submitting forms and running actions
- Pretty much anything to do with reactive front-ends
